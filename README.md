# WebFlicks ERD

I've always loved databases. This is my first attempt at creating an entity relationship diagram (ERD). This is a mock company called WebFlicks based on NetFlix. I learned a lot about database relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many), keys (primary, foreign, compound), and tables (through).

## Using the Repo

There isn't much to interact with. Take a look at the ERD and the relationships between each table.
